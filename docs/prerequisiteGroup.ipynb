    "# type PrerequisiteGroup\n",
    "\n",
    "This type represents a group of prerequisites that all have to be satisfied for the group to be satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Possible changes?\n",
    "- Extend towards groups of PrerequisiteGroups.\n",
    "- Extend towards 'any have to be satisfied'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "The PrerequisiteGroup type consists of the following field:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `prereqs::Vector{Prerequisite}`, which holds all the prerequisites in the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Possible changes?\n",
    "- Change type of `prereqs` to `Vector{Union{Prerequisite,PrerequisiteGroup}}`.  [*Is that even possible?*]\n",
    "- Add `aggregationType` to signify whether any single, or all prerequisite(groups) need to be satisfied for the entire group to be satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PrerequisiteGroup()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This creates a PrerequisiteGroup object without any prerequisites defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Possible changes?\n",
    "- Change constructor to `PrerequisiteGroup( isAll::Bool )` to set the aggregation strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The PrerequisiteGroup type has the following functions which are specific to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### addPrereq!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "addPrereq!( prereqGroup::PrerequisiteGroup, prereq::Prerequisite )\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function adds the given prerequisite to the group of prerequisites. Note that no check is performed whether this prerequisite is already in the group, or whether this is contradictory to any prior prerequisites.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Possible changes?\n",
    "- Add a variant `addPrereq!( prereqGroup::PrerequisiteGroup, prereqGroupToAdd::PrerequisiteGroup )`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### removePrereq!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "removePrereq!( prereqGroup::PrerequisiteGroup, index::T ) where T <: Integer\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function removes the prerequisites with the given index from the group of prerequisites. If the index is out of bounds, either $\\leqslant$ 0 or larger than the number of prerequisites, nothing happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### isSatisfied\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "isSatisfied( prereqGroup::PrerequisiteGroup, person::Personnel )\n",
    "isSatisfied( prereqGroup::PrerequisiteGroup, person::Personnel, timestamp::T ) where T <: Real\n",
    "isSatisfied( prereqGroup::PrerequisiteGroup, dbase::PersonnelDatabase, index::DbIndexType )\n",
    "isSatisfied( prereqGroup::PrerequisiteGroup, dbase::PersonnelDatabase, index::DbIndexType, timestamp::T ) where T <: Real\n",
    "```\n",
    "This group of functions test if a given person satisfies the given group of prerequisites and return `true` if these prerequisites are all satisfied, `false` otherwise. If the group is empty, the prerequisites are all assumed to be satisfied (as there are no restrictions to begin with).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first function, the specific person is passed as an argument, whereas in the third function, the personnel database and the index of the person (either as actual index, or as ID-key), are passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second and fourth functions are variants which test if the prerequisites are satisfied at the specified time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### countRecords\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "countRecords( dbase::PersonnelDatabase, prereqGroup::PrerequisiteGroup )\n",
    "countRecords( dbase::PersonnelDatabase, prereqGroup::PrerequisiteGroup, timestamp::T ) where T <: Real\n",
    "```\n",
    "This group of functions count how many records in the personnel database satisfy the group of prerequisites. The second function counts how many satisfied them at the given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### countFluxIn\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "countFluxIn( dbase::PersonnelDatabase, prereqGroup::PrerequisiteGroup, t_begin::T1, t_end::T2 ) where T1 <: Real where T2 <: Real\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function counts how many records in the personnel database started to satisfy the group of prerequisites during the period `[t_begin, t_end[`. This is computed by counting how many did not satisfy the prerequisites at `t_begin` and did satisfy them at `t_end`.  **<span style=\"color: red;\">This must be changed for it misses the possibility that someone starts to satisfy and then stops satisfying those prereqs in that time interval!</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### countFluxOut\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "countFluxOut( dbase::PersonnelDatabase, prereqGroup::PrerequisiteGroup, t_begin::T1, t_end::T2 ) where T1 <: Real where T2 <: Real\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function counts how many records in the personnel database stopped satisfying the group of prerequisites during the period `]t_begin, t_end]`. This is computed by counting how many satisfied the prerequisites at `t_begin` and did not satisfy them at `t_end`.  **<span style=\"color: red;\">This must be changed for it misses the possibility that someone stops satisfying and then resumes satisfying those prereqs in that time interval!</span>**"
